There are several ways to implement page routing in OpenHarmoy, each with its own suitable usage scenarios.

However, the official OpenHarmoy documentation is confusing and it is difficult for beginners to make sense of the logic and write usable code, and there are some misleading examples.

For this reason, I created this project, which contains all the common ways of implementing page routing currently (OpenHarmoy 3.2), showing the implementation and behavior of each method in a simple and clear way.
